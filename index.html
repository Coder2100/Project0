     	<li>Focused on bottom-up stock picking</li>

    <p> Our aim is to identify mispriced assets trading at discounts to their long-term business value (fair value) through extensive proprietary research. </p> 
  <h4>We aim higher</h4>
  <p> Our aim is to identify mispriced assets trading at discounts to their long-term business value (fair value) through extensive proprietary research. </p>
  <p>In calculating fair values, through our fundamental research, we focus on through-the-cycle normalised earnings and/or free cash flows using a long-term time horizon.</p>
  <p>We select managers who share a similar investment philosophy to ours. </p>
  <p>We do not equate risk with tracking error, or divergence from a benchmark, but rather with a permanent loss of capital.</p>
  <p>$100,000,000 invested at launch in July 2000, would have grown to $325,533,240 as at end February 2019.</p>
